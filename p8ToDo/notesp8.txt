In earlier projects, you learned how to add and remove classes from an element with el.classList.add() and el.classList.remove(). Another method to use with the classList property is the toggle method.
The toggle method will add the class if it is not present on the element, and remove the class if it is present on the element.
Example Code
element.classList.toggle("class-to-toggle");
Add an event listener to the openTaskFormBtn element and pass in a "click"

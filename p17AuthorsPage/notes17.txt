There is a method called fetch that allows code to receive data from an API by sending a GET request.
Here is how you can make a GET request with the fetch() method:
Example Code
fetch("url-goes-here")

// The fetch() method returns a Promise, which is a placeholder object that will either be fulfilled if your request is successful, or rejected if your request is unsuccessful.
// If the Promise is fulfilled, it resolves to a Response object, and you can use the .then() method to access the Response.
// Here's how you can chain .then() to the fetch() method:
// fetch("sample-url-goes-here")
//   .then((res) => res)

The .catch() method is another asynchronous JavaScript method you can use to handle errors. This is useful in case the Promise gets rejected.
